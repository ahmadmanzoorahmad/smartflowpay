`value`.\"}},\"title\":\"MockERC20\",\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/MockERC20.sol\":\"MockERC20\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/draft-IERC6093.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x19fdfb0f3b89a230e7dbd1cf416f1a6b531a3ee5db4da483f946320fc74afc0e\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://3490d794728f5bfecb46820431adaff71ba374141545ec20b650bb60353fac23\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPsfxjVpMcZbpE7BH93DzTpEaktESigEw4SmDzkXuJ4WR\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x86b7b71a6aedefdad89b607378eeab1dcc5389b9ea7d17346d08af01d7190994\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://1dc2db8d94a21eac8efe03adf574c419b08536409b416057a2b5b95cb772c43c\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZfqJCKVU1ScuX2A7s8WZdQEaikwJbDH5JBrBdKTUT4Gu\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x74ed01eb66b923d0d0cfe3be84604ac04b76482a55f9dd655e1ef4d367f95bc2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://5282825a626cfe924e504274b864a652b0023591fa66f06a067b25b51ba9b303\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmeCfPykghhMc81VJTrHTC7sF6CRvaA1FXVq2pJhwYp1dV\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Metadata.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xd6fa4088198f04eef10c5bce8a2f4d60554b7ec4b987f684393c01bf79b94d9f\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://f95ee0bbd4dd3ac730d066ba3e785ded4565e890dbec2fa7d3b9fe3bad9d0d6e\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmSLr6bHkPFWT7ntj34jmwfyskpwo97T9jZUrk5sz3sdtR\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x493033a8d1b176a037b2cc6a04dad01a5c157722049bbecf632ca876224dd4b2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6a708e8a5bdb1011c2c381c9a5cfd8a9a956d7d0a9dc1bd8bcdaf52f76ef2f12\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmax9WHBnVsZP46ZxEMNRQpLQnrdE4dK8LehML1Py8FowF\"]},\"contracts/MockERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x33bf344ad53b68b8ab48515c2874ef77cf2e066affa647d6b6a153a5cc815475\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://8ee9f648252e946e83d7a1b87403eee9bf27053fba5e0d522198834ceeae2017\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPHUP3EdZDpw84zLD2tK5UiZg3G5tH1eCixUF3tkS7Wmu\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"contracts/SmartFlowPayInvoices.sol":{"SmartFlowPayInvoices":{"abi":[{"inputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"constructor"},{"inputs":[],"name":"InsufficientBalance","type":"error"},{"inputs":[],"name":"InvalidAmount","type":"error"},{"inputs":[],"name":"InvalidRecipient","type":"error"},{"inputs":[],"name":"InvalidToken","type":"error"},{"inputs":[],"name":"InvoiceAlreadyExists","type":"error"},{"inputs":[],"name":"InvoiceAlreadyPaid","type":"error"},{"inputs":[],"name":"InvoiceExpired","type":"error"},{"inputs":[],"name":"InvoiceNotFound","type":"error"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"owner","type":"address"}],"name":"OwnableInvalidOwner","type":"error"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"account","type":"address"}],"name":"OwnableUnauthorizedAccount","type":"error"},{"inputs":[],"name":"ReentrancyGuardReentrantCall","type":"error"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"token","type":"address"}],"name":"SafeERC20FailedOperation","type":"error"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"bytes32","name":"invoiceId","type":"bytes32"},{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"merchant","type":"address"},{"indexed":false,"internalType":"address","name":"token","type":"address"},{"indexed":false,"internalType":"uint256","name":"amount","type":"uint256"},{"indexed":false,"internalType":"string","name":"note","type":"string"},{"indexed":false,"internalType":"uint256","name":"expiresAt","type":"uint256"}],"name":"InvoiceCreated","type":"event"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"bytes32","name":"invoiceId","type":"bytes32"},{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"merchant","type":"address"},{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"payer","type":"address"},{"indexed":false,"internalType":"address","name":"token","type":"address"},{"indexed":false,"internalType":"uint256","name":"amount","type":"uint256"}],"name":"InvoicePaid","type":"event"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"previousOwner","type":"address"},{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"newOwner","type":"address"}],"name":"OwnershipTransferred","type":"event"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"merchant","type":"address"},{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"to","type":"address"},{"indexed":false,"internalType":"address","name":"token","type":"address"},{"indexed":false,"internalType":"uint256","name":"amount","type":"uint256"}],"name":"Withdrawal","type":"event"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"token","type":"address"},{"internalType":"uint256","name":"amount","type":"uint256"},{"internalType":"string","name":"note","type":"string"},{"inte
